Android-Anymote
===============

<p>The Android-Anymote project provides an Android UI for <a href="https://github.com/entertailion/Anymote-for-Java">Anymote-for-Java</a> library to control <a href="https://developers.google.com/tv/">Google TV</a> devices. 
The Anymote-for-Java library was designed to be independent of a user interface. It comes with a default command-line user interface that can be replaced by any GUI.</p>

<p>Android-Anymote provides a basic example remote control user interface for Google TV devices. 
The user interface supports some of the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/anymote-protocol/source/browse/proto/keycodes.proto">key codes</a> provided by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/tv/remote/docs/anymote">Anymote protocol</a> for Google TV devices.
The Android-Anymote user interface shows how to invoke key codes for Home, Live TV, Back, Up, Left, Right, Down and OK.
It also has a touch panel to navigate apps like Chrome. Zoom and scrolling gestures are also supported. 
The menu option allows the user to switch between different devices.</p>

<p>Note: The Android-Anymote project includes the jar file for the <a href="https://github.com/entertailion/Anymote-for-Java">Anymote-for-Java</a> library in its lib directory. 
Developers should check out that project and export a jar file for the latest version of the code. 
When you export the Anymote-for-Java project as a jar file, do not include its lib directory since this project already includes those jar files.</p>
